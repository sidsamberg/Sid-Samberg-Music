              Born in 1989, Sid Samberg has been composing and performing his
              own music since the age of six. His music first gained attention
              in 1999 when he played for the world-renowned violinist Ida
              Haendel. He has since performed in New York, Montreal, Ann Arbor,
              Toronto, Puerto Rico and Chicago, at such venues as the Chicago

              Chicago composer Frank Abbinanti. His recent projects include a
              setting of the first Psalm for choir and chamber ensemble, a solo
              trumpet work based on Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream”
              speech (for Tage Larsen of the CSO), a single-movement piano
              concerto, and two piano works inspired by the writings of Philip
              K. Dick, The Man in the High Castle (2014) and A Scanner Darkly

              Samberg has performed in two groundbreaking works of the twentieth
              century: Treatise, by Cornelius Cardew, and In C, by Terry Riley.
              He has also given the world premieres of Kinderscenen South Africa
              and Lure, both for solo piano, by Frank Abbinanti, as well as
              Kaikhosru Sorabji's Transcendental Etude no. 38 in 2013. Samberg
              has written an article for Contemporary Music Review on the
              composer Frederic Rzewski, titled “Rzewski as Shaman: The Search
              for the Source of the Power behind The People United Will Never Be
              Defeated!“. At the age of 15, Samberg was the youngest person ever
              to lecture at St. Francis College (2004) on the history of music,
              playing examples from the Renaissance to the Twentieth century on
              both piano and viola. He has also lectured on the music of the
              Holocaust. His teachers have included Irene Faliks and Mikhail
              Yanovitsky on piano, as well as Patricia Berlett and Rami
              Solomonow on viola. In 2016, he began studies at California
              Institute of the Arts, with Michael Pisaro, Nicholas Deyoe, and
              Vicki Ray.
